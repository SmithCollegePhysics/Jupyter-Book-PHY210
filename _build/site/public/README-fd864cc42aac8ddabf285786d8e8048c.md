# Jupyter-Book-PHY210
respository for Jupyter Books (v2) for PHY210.  The first book in this repository is on the use of the symbolic mathematics Python package SymPy for common tasks in Math Methods courses (originally used in PHY 210 Math Methods Fall 2025). It consists of an introductory page written in markdown plus several Jupyter Notebooks that can downloaded and used as introductory tutorials and/or templates for class assignments. 

This will be hosted as a set of static webpages on GitHub; it does not yet feature any of the interactive features available in Jupyter Book 2.0 (that make use of MyST markdown).
